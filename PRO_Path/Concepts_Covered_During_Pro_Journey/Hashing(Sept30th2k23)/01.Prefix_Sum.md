# What is Prefix SUM ?

***Prefix sum, also known as cumulative sum, is a technique used in computer science and mathematics to efficiently calculate the sum of elements in a range of an array. It precomputes the cumulative sum of elements up to each position in the array and stores it in a separate data structure.***

```cpp

int arr=[9,8,7,6,5,11,43,65,12,98,007]

int pre_sum[arr.size()];

// Assign inital value as it won't have any pre values 

pre_sum[0]=arr[0];

for(int i=1;i<arr.size();++i)
{
    pre_sum[i]=pre_sum[i-1]+arr[i];
    // As shown in above picture we are taking the input from previous sum and the 
    // current index value in array
}

// Suppose i want the sum from index X to index Y

// then i can goto index Y and take it's value and deduct the value from X-1 index 

// Which just mean i will be removing the values from 0 to X-1 index from Y index sum 

// So all that it left with it is sum from X ...... to ....... Y
