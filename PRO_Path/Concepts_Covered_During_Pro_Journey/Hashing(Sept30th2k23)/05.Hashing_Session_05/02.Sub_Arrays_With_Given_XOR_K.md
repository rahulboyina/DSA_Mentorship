## What is XOR and some Property's

* Xor is an gate opertaion where the both the elements in the operation needed to be different to produce the Positive result else it will lead up to negative result.

* Property -> a^b=c -> b^c=a -> a^c=b;

ex: 4 -> 100(in Binary)
    2 -> 010(in Binary)
XOR = -> 110(which will convert to the 6 in binary)

### Brute Force Approach 

```cpp

// Find the all the sub-arrays using nested loop's
int sol(vector<int> &arr,int k)
{
int ctr=0;
for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
   {// The first loop will set the starting point or the element to begin as a sub-array
	for(int j=i;j<n;j++)
	{// The second loop will set the end point of the container till where our sub-array can be considered
	  int xor=0;
	  for(int k=i;k<=j;++k)
	  {// The third loop will take boundaries set the first two loops and generates the sub-arrays
	   xor^=arr[k];
	   // If elements are similar they cancel out(Property of XOR)
	  }
	  ctr=xor==k?++ctr:ctr;
	  // If the elements have exact have 0's and 1's placed alternatively as such when XOR operation performed they will form the element to that binary value.
	}
   }
return ctr;
}
```
* The time comlexity is O(n3).

### Better Solution

// We don't actually need the third sub-array but why?
// We are generating a new sub-arrays with the addition of the one new element to which we are doing the XOR operation.
// Here the elements from 0 to n-1 remain the same for larger extent. So, why can't we use previous result?

```cpp

// Find the all the sub-arrays using nested loop's
int sol(vector<int> &arr,int k)
{
int ctr=0;
for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
   {// The first loop will set the starting point or the element to begin as a sub-array
	for(int j=i;j<n;j++)
	{// The second loop will set the end point of the container till where our sub-array can be considered
	  int xor=0;
	   xor^=arr[k];
	  ctr=xor==k?++ctr:ctr;
	  // If the elements have exact have 0's and 1's placed alternatively as such when XOR operation performed they will form the element to that binary value.
	}
   }
return ctr;
}
```
* The time comlexity is O(n2).

### Optimal Solution

![The Process we are going to follow](https://takeuforward.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-02-011455.png)


```cpp

int sol(vector<int> &arr,int k)
{
   unordered_map<int,int> data;
// It will store all the possible key and their occurances

int xr=0;

data[xr]++;

int ctr=0;

int xor=0;

for(int i=0;i<arr.size();i++)
{
xor^=arr[i];

int x=xor^k;
// This will give the element from where we can beign with

ctr+=data[x];

data[xor]++;

}
return ctr;
}

```
