```cpp

typedef unordered_map<int,int> um;

#define loop(i,a,b) for(int i=a;i<b;++i)
class Solution {
public:
    int subarraySum(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        // Algorithm 

// Q1. What did i understand about this problem?
// Ans: Given a array we need to find will it form the sum k we are looking for during the summation of contigious elements from different index's lineraly.

// Observations : Sum + Linear -> 90% i feel Prefix sum will be best approach


// Step 01:

// Take an Unordered map and store the what ?

// I know one value is Sum what would other be i don't want the index's from where we could find the sum i just need their occurances like K exist or not let's say sum is K(3 for time being) and three occured five times so i can say answer can be minimum of 5 and max until all combinations are seen. Which says secnond argument is frequency of occurance.

um data;//{Sum,Occurances}
int ctr=0,sum=0;

// Step 02:

// Get the sum and input it into the map and keep track of it's occurances

// Used Marcros for the first time to run the LOOP.
loop(i,0,nums.size())
{
    // Calculating the sum of the each element to it's prior values.
    sum+=nums[i];
    // We got a sum now the sum might exceed the less of certain value to be added to it so will find that value is present in the occurances so far.
    /*
    ex: sum so far is 1 and k =3 so i can say 1-3=x -> x=-2 -> so if we have occurance of minus two from there to the current value we could have the subarray
    */
    int val=sum-k;
    // The sum so far is only value  K we are looking for then what is the need to deduct k from k and see if the zero occurs some where from there we can add one more occurance.
    if(sum==k){ctr++;}
    // Check for the remaining value has occured so far if yes then we can icnrement out counter else add it's occurance.
    // If the val we are looking for doesn't exist in map then we will return 0 to add into the solution.
    ctr+=data[val];
    data[sum]++;
}

return ctr;
    }
};
