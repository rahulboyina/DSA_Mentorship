## Question 01 : [2657. Find the Prefix Common Array of Two Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-prefix-common-array-of-two-arrays/description/?source=submission-ac)

### Description:

You are given two 0-indexed integer permutations A and B of length n.

A prefix common array of A and B is an array C such that C[i] is equal to the count of numbers that are present at or before the index i in both A and B.

Return the prefix common array of A and B.

A sequence of n integers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from 1 to n exactly once.

 

Example 1:

Input: A = [1,3,2,4], B = [3,1,2,4]
Output: [0,2,3,4]
Explanation: At i = 0: no number is common, so C[0] = 0.
At i = 1: 1 and 3 are common in A and B, so C[1] = 2.
At i = 2: 1, 2, and 3 are common in A and B, so C[2] = 3.
At i = 3: 1, 2, 3, and 4 are common in A and B, so C[3] = 4.
Example 2:

Input: A = [2,3,1], B = [3,1,2]
Output: [0,1,3]
Explanation: At i = 0: no number is common, so C[0] = 0.
At i = 1: only 3 is common in A and B, so C[1] = 1.
At i = 2: 1, 2, and 3 are common in A and B, so C[2] = 3.

### Brute Force:

1. I have used the set's to track the element's in sorted order and set_intersection method to find similar element's in Set's.

2. Overhead's -> Set's, Adding element's to set's, Intersection, Tracking Frequencies.

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findThePrefixCommonArray(vector<int>& A, vector<int>& B) {
        set<int>a,b;
        size_t size=A.size();
        vector<int>ans,ele;
        for(int i=0;i<size;++i)
        {
        a.insert(A[i]);
        b.insert(B[i]);
        set_intersection(a.begin(),a.end(),b.begin(),b.end(),back_inserter(ele));
        ans.push_back(ele.size());
        ele.clear();
        }
        return ans;
    }
};

```

### Optimize:

1. Why should i use the prefix kind of thing and need to lean back to whole of the set to see the element's in common in the each and every instance.

2. Suppose i have 2 common element's now i have iterated over another element if it is unique then continue if it already exist then it just mean we found another common element between 2 array's.

3. So, to acheive this both of the array's element's needed to be tracked into an single unique container and every time i find the element twice we found another common element let's increment the unique element's count in the ans container for the index we are in of the container's A and B.

## 02: Question [890. Find and Replace Pattern](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-and-replace-pattern/description/)

890. Find and Replace Pattern
Attempted
Medium
Topics
Companies
Given a list of strings words and a string pattern, return a list of words[i] that match pattern. You may return the answer in any order.

A word matches the pattern if there exists a permutation of letters p so that after replacing every letter x in the pattern with p(x), we get the desired word.

Recall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to letters: every letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to the same letter.

 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["abc","deq","mee","aqq","dkd","ccc"], pattern = "abb"
Output: ["mee","aqq"]
Explanation: "mee" matches the pattern because there is a permutation {a -> m, b -> e, ...}. 
"ccc" does not match the pattern because {a -> c, b -> c, ...} is not a permutation, since a and b map to the same letter.
Example 2:

Input: words = ["a","b","c"], pattern = "a"
Output: ["a","b","c"]
 

Constraints:

1 <= pattern.length <= 20
1 <= words.length <= 50
words[i].length == pattern.length
pattern and words[i] are lowercase English letters.


### Brute_Force:

```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> findAndReplacePattern(vector<string>& words, string pattern) {
        vector<int>p;

        int ctr=1;

        size_t&& size=pattern.size();

        for(int i=0;i<size-1;++i)
        {
            if(pattern[i]==pattern[i+1]) ++ctr;
            else
            {
                // cout<<ctr<<endl;
                p.push_back(ctr);
                ctr=1;
            }
        }

        p.push_back(ctr);

        for(auto i:p)cout<<i<<endl;

        vector<string>ans;

        for(string s:words)
        {
            ctr=1;
            int idx=0;
            bool flag=true;
            for(int i=0;i<s.size()-1;i++)
            {
                if(s[i]==s[i+1])++ctr;
                else
                {   
                    if(idx==p.size() || ctr!=p[idx++])
                    {
                        flag=false;
                        break;
                    }
                    ctr=1;
                }
                if(flag&&idx==p.size()-1)
                {
                    if(p[p.size()-1]==ctr) 
                    {
                        ans.push_back(s);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        if(size==1) return words;
        return ans;

    }
};

```

### Optimized:

1. Pattern's can be as per my convience just like rubix cube algo bring it to the common base state irrespective of it's current state.

```cpp

class Solution {

private:

string solve(string s)
{
    string ans;

    char c[256]={0};

    char start='a';

    for(char ch:s)
    {
        if(c[ch]==0)
        {
            c[ch]=start++;
        }
        ans+=c[ch];
    }

    return ans;
}

public:
    vector<string> findAndReplacePattern(vector<string>& words, string pattern) {
     string pp=solve(pattern);
     vector<string>ans;

     for(string s:words)
     {
         if(pp==solve(s))ans.push_back(s);
     }   

     return ans;
    }
};

```


## Question 03 : [1930. Unique Length-3 Palindromic Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-length-3-palindromic-subsequences/description/)

### Example Explanation

* Let's break down the solution step by step using tables to visualize the process:

### Example:

* Given String: "aabca"

### Iteration through Characters 'a' to 'z':

###Explanation:

1. Character 'a':

* First occurrence at index 0, last occurrence at index 3.
* Iterate from index 1 to 2, marking characters 'a' and 'b' as visited.
* Unique characters count (t): 3.
* Add t to the total count (a): 3.

2. Character 'd' to 'z':

* Not found in the given string, so no further actions are taken.

### Result:
** Total Palindromes Count (a): 3 **

### Intuition

** The problem asks for the count of unique palindromes of length three that are subsequences of the given string s. A palindrome of length three has the form "aba". To count these palindromes, the solution seems to iterate through the string, finding the first and last occurrences of each character and checking the characters in between. **

### Approach
1. Iterate through each character from 'a' to 'z'.
2. For each character, find the first and last occurrence in the string s.
3. If the first occurrence is not found, move to the next character.
4. If the first occurrence is found, iterate from the next index to the last occurrence.
* For each character in between, mark it as visited to avoid duplicate counting.
* Increment a counter for unique characters.
* If the counter reaches 26 (the total number of lowercase English letters), break the loop to avoid unnecessary iterations.
5. Add the counter value to the total count.

Complexity

### Time Complexity: O(N)

1. The solution iterates through the string once for each character, and the inner loop iterates through the characters between the first and last occurrences.

### Space Complexity: O(1)

1. The solution uses a constant amount of space for the boolean array v and some variables, independent of the input size.

``` cpp

class Solution {
public:
    int countPalindromicSubsequence(string s) {

        int total=0,first,last;
        size_t size=s.size();
        char ch='a';
        while(ch<='z')
        {
            for(first=0;first<size;++first)
            {
                if(s[first]==ch) break;
            }

            last=size-1;

            for(last=size-1;last>=0;--last)
            {
                if(s[last]==ch) break;
            }
            ++ch;
            if(first==last) continue;

            bitset<128>bset;
            
            for(int i=first+1;i<last;++i)
            {
                bset.set(s[i]);
            }

            total+=bset.count();
        }
        return total;
    }
};

```
