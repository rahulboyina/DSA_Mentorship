01.[2475. Number of Unequal Triplets in Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-unequal-triplets-in-array/description/)

**Description**

You are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers nums. Find the number of triplets (i, j, k) that meet the following conditions:

0 <= i < j < k < nums.length
nums[i], nums[j], and nums[k] are pairwise distinct.
In other words, nums[i] != nums[j], nums[i] != nums[k], and nums[j] != nums[k].
Return the number of triplets that meet the conditions.

``` cpp

class Solution {
public:
    int unequalTriplets(vector<int>& nums) {

     // Algorithm 

     // I was ammused with this level of pattern recognizition and it was super clean and out of the box i mean wow.

     // Suppose you want to want find triplet's basic rule is you need atleast three element's in it to form one triplet.

     // Let's say i keep cluster's(Group of element's) and perfrom the operation considering few constraint's as below.

     // Basic intution is i am going to keep track of number of element's that occured previous to my current element -> I will make a pair with it just like previous elements will be acting like i and current element is like j and we will be pairing these two (Previous,current) with next (The unexplored elements) which would look like pair(pair(i,j),k) forming triplet's

     unordered_map<int,int> data;

     for(int &x:nums) data[x]++;

     int count=0,previous_elements=0,current_element,next_elements=nums.size();

    for(auto[num,c_freq]:data)
    {
        next_elements=next_elements-c_freq;
        count=count+(previous_elements*c_freq*next_elements);
        previous_elements=previous_elements+c_freq;
    }
        return count;
    }
};

01.Number of Unequal Triplets in Array(Character's)

00. Ok Rahul let's go now let's conquer this problem.

01. Now tell me what did you even understand about this problem  
  
-> I need to find the unique element's of  count three in a array arr such that arr[i]!=arr[j]!=arr[k] and i<j<k  
  
-> But let me question something from my past experience it doesn't really matter if the what ever the element it need's to be unique and i need just it's frequency.  
  
-> What does i mean irrespective of the position of the element in the array they will the count of triplet's will remain unchanged.  
  
-> let's consider a example arr=[1,1,2,3] count =2(1,2,3 & 1,2,3) what if it is arr=[2,1,3,1] count=2(2,1,3 &2,3,1)  
  
-> So now i am clear of myth of order blah blah all it really matter's is element and it's frequency that's a really good depection isn't it  
  
-> Now let's shead a light on the bit more complicated example arr=[1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4];  
  Frequency's as follows {1,4},{2,4},{3,4},{4,5} So, now how can i tell how many unique triplet's like every element in 1 can form possible triplet with every element in 2,3 or 2,4 or 3,4  
 In the same way every element in 2 can form a triplet with 3 and 4.  
  
-> Very Interesting the above observation will can be deduced to below logic  
a. Every element will try to form the triplet will every other element in the and there is an confusing constraint such as (i<j<k) it really doesn't matter what actually fit's in the values fall's under it but it will tell us to avoiding the duplicates.
b. if we have a unique elements as A,B,C,D the combinations will be as follow's
|ABCD|Combinations|
|----|------------|
||A,B,C|
||A,C,D|
||B,C,D|

**I Can write the above observation in another way as well as when I'm on element A i will have A(B,C,D)-> A,B,C & A,C,D**
**When I'm on element B I can have (A)B(C,D)-> A,B,C & A,C,D**
**When I'm on element C I can have (A,B)C(D)-> A,B,C & A,C,D**
**When I'm on element D I can have (A,B,C)D-> A,B,C & A,C,D**

**If I'm on a element i would see if there is an previous elements to it if yes then what is it's frequency as i can form a combination with each one of it's occurance and is there any element's in future unexplored if yes they can also be the combination with our current element so let's consider them as well**

*So Current element can be multilied with all the element's occured prior to it (Exluding all it's occurance's) and remaining element's (Excluding the current element frequency's)*


```cpp

int solution(vector<string>&arr) 
{
int prev=0,curr,next=arr.size(),count=0;

// to track Frequency's -> Use Hashmap

unordered_map<char,int> data;

for(char &x:arr) data[x]++;

// Now let's iterate over the map using Auto and Structured Binding

for(const auto& [val,freq]:data)
{
// So let's calucalte the frequency of current element

//count+=prev*freq*next;
// But next has the size of the all the element's i think i need to exclude the current element and it's digit's

next=next-freq;
// The current number of element's are excluded
count+=prev*freq*next;

prev+=freq;
// Prev will store the count of all the explored element's
}
return count;
}

```
