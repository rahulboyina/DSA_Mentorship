# Largest Sub Array with Given Sum

**It was a very intersting approach basically i didn't get that in the inital state but when i got the logic it was just magic**

## Algorithm 

1. Ok assuming you know what is prefix sum I'm saying this approach(Sum of all previous element's to the element we are accessing in short).

2. Now we have prefix sum of the contianer we are having

ex: arr=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

	PS=[1,3,6,10,15,21,28,36,45]

3. Here suppose we want to find the sum between the index 3 and 6 what can we so using prefix sum array
*x=Sum till 6 will have sum from 0 index to the index 6
*y=Sum till 3 will have sum from 0 index to the index 3
**So can't i say x-y = sum till index 6 deduct the values from 0 to 3 from it so we are going to be left with sum of 3 to 6**

4. So we want to find the length of the maximum sub array we can use the distance between two similar values in prefix sum array(excluding the start value).


```cpp

int sol(vector<int> &arr,int n)
{

unordered_map<int,int> prefixSum;

int len=0;

int sum=arr[0];

prefixSum[sum]=0;

for(int i=1;i<n;++i)
{
 sum+=arr[i];
auto itr=prefixSum.find(sum);
if(itr!=prefixSum.end())
{
 int temp=i-prefixSum[sum];
 len=max(len,temp);
}
else
{
  prefixSum[sum]=i;
}
}

return len;
}


```
