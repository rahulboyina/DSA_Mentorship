        // PS  : We need to find the conscicutive sequence which just mean no breaks from one another.

        1. How will you store the data -> array's or map's -> Map's
        Why ease of reterival of data.
        unordered_map<int,bool> data;

        2. Now we did store the data how could you find the sequence of that data i mean like how could you predict where to start with or starting point.
        simple logic the element previous value shouldn't exist then it is the starting element or else there are so many other elements are present to  be traversed.

        3.  If you are in starting position then we could start moving forward till the condition doesn't become false.

        4. Once it becomes false then we should compare our current string with the existing string length value update with maximum value.

        5. Need to do till end and will return the sequence value at end;

        unordered_map<int,bool> data;
        int sequence=0;
        for(auto x:nums) data[x]=true;

        for(auto x:nums)
        {
            if(!data[x-1])
            {
                int len=0;
                int start=x;
                while(data[start])
                {
                    len++;
                    start++;
                }
