        // Algorithm
        // This is a very very interesting approach i came across
        /*
        PS : We need to find all the repeating and common character's from all the words.

        01. Obivous Solution is HashMap which will hit your or my brain but ask your self does that memeory comosumed compensate the effort put into it this can be a simple array as well as the scope is confined to 26 character's only so declare a main array which would have the size of 26.

        02. So now let's go to our input words they could be of various sizes of input containing the words of different length's.
        So, let's traverse through each of the word and input it into an map which would be acting as a temp buffer to store these values.

        03. Once you have traversed the word sucessfully and frequency incremented then we compare the frequency of the current temp buffer and the 
main common freq array and update the min value in it as the min value will sustain. (Here no value exist then 0 is a min value if a value exist then it would be compared and swapped or updated into the minimum frequency array)

        // S1

        vector<int> all_freq(26,INT_MAX);
        
        // S2

        for(auto word:words)
        {
            // Now we have reference to individual words

            // Let's go through that word to find the frequency of the each character.
            // But where could we store those words in which storage declare the map.
            unordered_map<char,int> temp_buffer;

            for(auto ch:word)
            {
                temp_buffer[ch]++;
            }
            // We are going to capture the frequency of each character in the word's array.
            for(int i=0;i<26;++i)
            {
                all_freq[i]=min(all_freq[i],temp_buffer[char(i+'a')]);
            }
        }

        vector<string> str;

            for(int i=0;i<26;++i)
            {
                while(all_freq[i]>0)
                {
                    str.push_back(string(1,char(i+'a')));
                    --all_freq[i];
                }
                // Here 1st thing in my head is what on this earth is string(1,char('a)) what is this saying -> create the string of length 1 and assign the value given there using the string constructor.
