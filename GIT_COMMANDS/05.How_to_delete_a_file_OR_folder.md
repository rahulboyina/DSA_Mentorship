To delete a file or folder in a Git repository using the terminal, follow these steps:

### Deleting a File:

1. **Remove the file from your local directory:**
   ```bash
   rm filename.ext
   ```
   Replace `filename.ext` with the actual name and extension of the file you want to delete.

2. **Stage the deletion:**
   ```bash
   git add filename.ext
   ```

3. **Commit the change:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Deleted filename.ext"
   ```

4. **Push the changes to the remote repository:**
   ```bash
   git push origin branch-name
   ```
   Replace `branch-name` with the name of the branch you're working on.

### Deleting a Folder:

1. **Remove the folder and its contents from your local directory:**
   ```bash
   rm -r foldername
   ```
   Replace `foldername` with the name of the folder you want to delete.

2. **Stage the deletion:**
   ```bash
   git add foldername
   ```

3. **Commit the change:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Deleted foldername"
   ```

4. **Push the changes to the remote repository:**
   ```bash
   git push origin branch-name
   ```
   Replace `branch-name` with the name of the branch you're working on.

Please exercise caution when deleting files and folders, as this action is irreversible. Ensure that you're deleting the correct files and that you've made backups if needed.

Remember that these commands will also delete the files or folders from the remote repository once you push the changes.
