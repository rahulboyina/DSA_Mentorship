To rename a file in a Git repository using the Git terminal, you can follow these steps:

1. **Rename the File:**
   Use the `mv` command to rename the file. Here's the basic syntax:

   ```bash
   git mv old-filename new-filename
   ```

   For example, if you want to rename `old-file.txt` to `new-file.txt`, you would use:

   ```bash
   git mv old-file.txt new-file.txt
   ```

2. **Commit the Change:**
   After renaming the file, you need to commit the change. Here's the command:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Renamed file from old-file.txt to new-file.txt"
   ```

   This commits the change to your local repository.

3. **Push the Changes:**
   If you want to reflect this change on the remote repository on GitHub, you need to push the commit:

   ```bash
   git push origin branch-name
   ```

   Replace `branch-name` with the name of the branch you are working on.

After these steps, the file will be renamed both locally and on the remote repository.

Remember, if you're working with a branch, make sure you're on the correct branch when you perform these operations. Additionally, ensure that the file you're renaming is tracked by Git. If it's not, you'll need to `git add` it before using `git mv`.
