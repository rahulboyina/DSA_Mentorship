To move files and folders from one branch to another in a GitHub repository, you can follow these steps:

1. **Switch to the Source Branch:**
   First, make sure you are on the branch from which you want to move the files.

   ```bash
   git checkout source-branch
   ```

2. **Move Files and Folders:**
   Use the `git mv` command to move files or folders to the desired location.

   ```bash
   git mv source-path destination-path
   ```

   Replace `source-path` with the path to the file or folder you want to move, and `destination-path` with the path to where you want to move it.

   For example, if you want to move a file named `file.txt` from the root directory to a folder named `new_folder`:

   ```bash
   git mv file.txt new_folder/
   ```

   Commit the move:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Moved file.txt to new_folder"
   ```

3. **Switch to the Target Branch:**
   Switch to the branch where you want to move the files.

   ```bash
   git checkout target-branch
   ```

4. **Merge Changes:**
   Merge the source branch into the target branch.

   ```bash
   git merge source-branch
   ```

5. **Push the Changes:**
   Push the changes to the remote repository.

   ```bash
   git push origin target-branch
   ```

Now, the files and folders that you moved will be in the target branch. Keep in mind that this process involves modifying the history of both branches, so it's important to communicate with your team and consider potential conflicts.

Please make sure to backup your repository or work on a separate copy if you are not confident about these operations, as they can affect your project's codebase.



## Easy Alternative

*Goto the destination branch where you want to move the files*

```bash
gitcheckout destination_branch
```

```bash
git checkout source_branch file_to_move1.format<space>file_to_move2.format<space>.....So..On
```
