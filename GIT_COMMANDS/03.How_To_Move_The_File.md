To move files from one folder to another using the Git terminal, you can use the `git mv` command. This command is similar to the standard `mv` command in Unix-like systems, but it also records the move operation in Git's history.

Here's the basic syntax:

```bash
git mv source-file destination-folder/
```

Replace `source-file` with the name of the file you want to move and `destination-folder/` with the path of the folder you want to move the file to.

For example, if you want to move a file named `example.txt` from the current directory to a folder named `new_folder`, you would use:

```bash
git mv example.txt new_folder/
```

After running this command, you need to commit the change to record the move operation:

```bash
git commit -m "Moved example.txt to new_folder"
```

This will commit the move operation and update Git's history to reflect the change.

Keep in mind that both the source file and the destination folder should be part of your Git repository for this operation to work. If they are not, you'll need to add them to the repository first using `git add`.

Also, remember that `git mv` is not necessary for moving files within the same directory. You can use the standard `mv` command for that, and then use `git add` and `git commit` to stage and commit the changes.
